# CS 303 - Logic and Digital System Design

**Course Description:** The course aims to develop the engineering skills of the students to analyze and design digital systems: Number systems and conversion, Boolean algebra, the assertion level concept; minterm and maxterm expansions, Karnaugh maps, and Quine McCluskey minimization, combinatorial logic circuit design, NAND and NOR gate based design. State machines and sequential circuits flip-flops, minimization of state tables, state assignment. Higher-level digital system design using SSI-MSI blocks such multiplexers/decoders, adders, memory and programmable gate arrays; bus oriented systems. Asynchronous sequential circuits, flow tables, timing hazards. And, this is my term project in this course in the Spring 2021-2022 term at Sabanci University, Istanbul, Turkey.
